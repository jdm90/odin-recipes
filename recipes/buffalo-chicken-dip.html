    <h2>A Southern Favorite!</h2>
        <p>This is by far one of my favorite recipes to make during football season. It is simple, yet delicious. And even quite filling! We have sometimes (accidentally) substituted this dip for a meal!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>1 rotisserie chicken</ul>
        <ul>2, 8 ounce packages of cream cheese, softened</ul>
        <ul>1 cup Ranch dressing</ul>
        <ul>1 cup of your favorite buffalo wing sauce, or pepper sauce (e.g. Frank's Red HotÂ®)</ul>
        <ul>2 cups shredded Cheddar or Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</ul>
        <ul>1 bunch celery, cleaned and cut into 4 inch pieces</ul>
        <ul>Finely sliced green onions or chives</ul>
